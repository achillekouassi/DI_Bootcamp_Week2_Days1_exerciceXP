/*
For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.
Of course, explain each prediction.
Then run the expression in the console. Note the actual output in a comment and compare it with your prediction.



For example

console.log(2+3)
// Prediction: It will output 5, because 2 and 3 are numbers
// Actual: 5


Using the code below:

    let c;
    let a = 34;
    let b = 21;

    console.log(a+b) //first expression
    // Prediction:
    // Actual:

    a = 2;

    console.log(a+b) //second expression
    // Prediction:
    // Actual:

*/
//What will be the outcome of a + b in the first expression ?
let c;
let a=34;
let b=21;
console.log(a+b);
//Prediction: It will output 55 because 34 and 21 are numbers
//Actual:55
a=2
/*What will be the outcome of a + b in the second expression ? */
console.log(a+b);

//Prediction: It will output 23 because 2 and 21 are numbers
//Actual:23

/* What is the value of c? */
console.log(c);
// Prediction: the value of c is undefined because it is not assigned to any value
// Actual: undefined

/*
Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?
console.log(3 + 4 + '5');*/

console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
/*Prediction: It will output '75' because at frist 3 and 4 
are numbers so these addition will give 7, secondly '5' is a string then when 
it is added to 7, it give '75' as a string
*/
// Actual:75
